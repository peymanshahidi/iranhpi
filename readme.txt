** instructions for "iranhpi" command by Peyman Shahidi **

In order to test the "iranhpi" command follow these steps:
1. Move "iranhpi.ado" to your personal adopath directory (or you may use "main.do" to specify your personal settings).
2. Run "test_iranhpi.do". The code provided in this file allows you to test different options of the command.

p.s.: "createSample.do" is used to create a random sample from the transactions occurred in Tehran in the main dataset. The resulting dataset is included in the current path under the name of "iranhpi_test.dta". You may ignore this file and only run "test_iranhpi.do".
